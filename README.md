## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is user data transmitted to external servers?**  
A: No. All processing occurs locally on your machine. Ollama handles AI inference entirely offline.

**Q: Is macOS or Linux support available?**  
A: Currently Windows-only due to system automation dependencies. Cross-platform support is planned for future releases.

**Q: What are the memory requirements during operation?**  
A: Approximately 2-4 GB while idle, 6-8 GB during active AI processing.

**Q: Can alternative AI models be used?**  
A: Yes. Any Ollama-compatible model can be configured via the `MODEL_NAME` variable in `.env`.

**Q: Is Telegram integration mandatory?**  
A: Telegram is required for remote control functionality. Voice-only operation mode is planned for future releases.

**Q: How can I contribute to the project?**  
A: See the Contributing section for detailed guidelines.

**Q: Does auto-start impact system boot performance?**  
A: No. The assistant launches as a background process after Windows initialization, using minimal system resources.

**Q: How do I disable the activity monitoring feature?**  
A: Uninstall the browser extension and remove the `activity_monitor.py` file from the project directory.
